**Project Objective :**
The main objective of the project is to make predictions about the future performance of football players using statistical indicators. This model helps football clubs and analysts identify the players who are likely to score the most goals in the future.

**Technologies Used :**

- Python: The main programming language for the project
- Pandas: For loading and cleaning data
- NumPy: For calculations on data
- scikit-learn: For building and evaluating Machine Learning models
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook: For running code and conducting analyses

**Project Steps:**

- Data Loading and Cleaning: Cleaning the dataset containing football players' statistics and preparing it for analysis.
- Model Selection and Development: Developed and trained Polynomial Linear Regression and XGBOOST models.
- Model Testing and Evaluation: Analyzed the model using various evaluation metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
- Predicting Future Goals: Estimated the future goals of the top 5 players likely to score the most.
- Visualization: Graphically visualized the data and analyzed the results.

**Polynomial Linear Regression Model Performance:**

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 8.457
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.908
- R² Score: 0.755
- These results indicate the overall performance of the model and can be used for future improvements.


**XGBOOST Model Performance:** 

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 7.883
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.807
- R² Score: 0.772
